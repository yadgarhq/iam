//! Wiring, and one decision worth naming: this service does NOT wait for
//! `iam-db` to be reachable before reporting ready.
//!
//! The twin's own boot is gated — probe, migrate, then listen (D69) — so a
//! `-db` that is not ready has no DNS endpoint behind the headless Service, and
//! `balance::connect` fails loudly. Blocking this service's startup on that would
//! turn one module's slow migration into a cascading outage across everything
//! that depends on it, and under D68 a pod stuck in startup is one the autoscaler
//! cannot help. Failing a request with UNAVAILABLE is recoverable; refusing to
//! start is not.
//!
//! The crypto keys are a different story: they are NOT optional and their
//! absence DOES block startup. A service that started without them would boot
//! successfully and then fail every request touching a credential or a personal
//! data field (D72) — a failure mode that looks like a healthy pod until traffic
//! hits it. Failing fast at boot turns that into a CrashLoopBackOff, which is
//! legible, instead of a pod that passes its readiness probe and is wrong.
